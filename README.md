# CS499 Independent Study Proposal: Modern Software Development with Rust

## Introduction

Cadet Enrique Oti, Cadet Ethan Chapman, Cadet Rylie Anderson, and Cadet David Petzold request permission to take a CS 499 with Lt Col McGinthy to learn secure programming practices and perform research in the Rust programming language to create a course curriculum designed for USAFA Cadets. This proposal describes the scope of work in consideration for 3 credit hours.

## Course Objectives

The proposed CS 499 will focus on developing the cadetâ€™s knowledge and experience with the following Computer and/or Cyber Sciences concepts:

- **a.** Why Rust was created, use cases, pros and cons
- **b.** Basic Rust Syntax
- **c.** Memory Model and Ownership
- **d.** Error Handling
- **e.** Iterators
- **f.** Asynchronous Programming and Concurrency
- **g.** Network Programming

## Proposal

This course will involve a mix of theoretical learning and practical application. Cadets will develop lesson plans, lesson exercises, and small to medium-sized projects to solidify their understanding of Rust programming concepts. Regular assignments and quizzes will also be part of the coursework to ensure continuous learning and assessment.

### Resources required:
- Any Rust-compatible IDE
- GitHub Classroom for project/homework submissions and autograding

## Schedule and Deliverables

The following table describes the schedule and deliverables for this study:

| Week | Date | Description | Deliverable(s) |

## Course Outcomes

- **a.** Proficiency in Rust programming language.
- **b.** Ability to develop and manage memory-safe applications.
- **c.** Skills in concurrent and network programming using Rust.
- **d.** Develop lesson plans and exercises tied to course objectives
- **e.** Develop programming assessments to ensure students are understanding concepts and objectives in a controlled environment
- **f.** Development of practical applications demonstrating Rust's capabilities.
- **g.** Cadets will deliver model assignments and assessments focusing on Rust, based on the course objectives described above.

## Recommendation

This course proposal presents an opportunity for cadets to engage with a modern, safe, and powerful programming language. The balance of theoretical and practical learning will provide a comprehensive understanding of Rust, equipping cadets with skills relevant to contemporary software development challenges. Approval of this proposal is respectfully requested.
