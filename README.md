MEMORANDUM FOR DFCS CURRICULUM COMMITTEE

FROM: Enrique Oti, Ethan Chapman, Rylie Anderson, David Petzold

SUBJECT: CS499 Independent Study Proposal: Modern Software Development
with Rust

1.  Cadet Enrique Oti, Cadet Ethan Chapman, Cadet Rylie Anderson and
    Cadet David Petzold request permission to take a CS 499 with Lt Col
    McGinthy to learn secure programming practices and perform research
    in the Rust programming language to create a course curriculum
    designed for USAFA Cadets. This proposal describes the scope of work
    in consideration for 3 credit hours.

2.  **Course Objectives**. The proposed CS 499 will focus on developing
    the cadet's knowledge and experience with the following Computer
    and/or Cyber Sciences concepts:

    a.  Why Rust was created, use cases, pros and cons

    b.  Basic Rust Syntax

    c.  Memory Model and Ownership

    d.  Error Handling

    e.  Iterators

    f.  Asynchronous Programming and Concurrency

    g.  Network Programming

3.  Proposal: This course will involve a mix of theoretical learning and
    practical application. Cadets will develop lesson plans, lesson
    exercises, and small to medium-sized projects to solidify their
    understanding of Rust programming concepts. Regular assignments and
    quizzes will also be part of the coursework to ensure continuous
    learning and assessment.

-   Resources required:

    -   Any Rust-compatible IDE

    -   GitHub Classroom for project/homework submissions and
        autograding

4.  **Schedule and Deliverables**. The following table describes the
    schedule and deliverables for this study
